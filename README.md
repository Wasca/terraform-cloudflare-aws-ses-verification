# Terraform Module Cloudflare AWS SES Verification

This is a small module that wraps required Cloudflare and AWS resources for verifying a domain for SES.

> DO NOT FORGET: When adding a new second level domain, you must ask AWS support to disable SES sandbox before being able to send mail to other domains.
